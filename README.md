# disquaire

disquaire is a static site that grabs data from a Discogs user's inventory (see [Discogs Marketplace](https://www.discogs.com/sell/list)) and displays it in a (hopefully) pretty and convenient way. It has a dedicated CMS to customize the site with notes and categories. 

disquaire powers (link to ajna management) but it can be adapted for any Discogs inventory
